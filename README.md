# Lead Your Own Discussion Starter Kit

As students in my discussion know, I wasn't able to connect my laptop to the projector, so I did all the examples on the board.
Since it is hard to understand everything without examples, I've made this Lead Your Own Discussion Starter Kit (LYODSK).
The topics covered are:

* makefiles
* getopt
* gdb
* valgrind

Each topic is in its own folder with its own README, please explore at your leisure.
